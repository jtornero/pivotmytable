PivotMyTable
============

**PivotMyTablee is a PL/Python function** for use in PostgreSQL servers. Its aim is **to get crosstab/pivoted tables in a more friendly way** that PostgreSQL module *tablefunc* does with its *crosstab* series functions and in fact it behaves ,at last, as a proxy for tablefunc functions.

**PivotMyTablee makes it possible** in the same way that other available solutions, **automating the creation of the queries** that the *tablefunc* *crosstab* functions need to work.

Also, **PivotMyTablee makes possible to directly get percentages** in the pivoted tables, **as well as get rid of null values in the oputput** tables.
